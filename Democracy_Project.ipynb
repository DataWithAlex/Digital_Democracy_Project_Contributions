It mentions the medical and surgical costs of her treatment, as well as the financial impact of her lost earnings. Additionally, it acknowledges the mental pain and suffering endured by her surviving family members. The page also refers to an internal investigation conducted by the department into the cause of the collision.\n","Summary of page 3:\n","Page 3 of the bill acknowledges that a collision resulting in the death of Molly Parker was solely caused by the negligence of a department employee. A final judgment was entered in favor of the estate in the amount of $6.25 million, of which $300,000 has already been paid by the department. The unpaid settlement amount of $5.95 million is now being appropriated from the department.\n","Summary of page 4:\n","Page 4 of the bill states that $5.95 million will be allocated from the State Transportation Trust Fund to the Department of Transportation to compensate the Estate of Molly Parker for injuries and damages sustained resulting in her death. The Chief Financial Officer is directed to draw a warrant in favor of the Estate of Molly Parker and pay it out of the Department of Transportation funds in the State Treasury. The bill also specifies that the amount paid to the Estate, along with the amount paid by the Division of Risk Management and attorney fees, will be the sole compensation for all present and future claims related to Molly Parker's death, and that lien interests for her care and treatment will be waived.
